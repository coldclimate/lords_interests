lords_interests
===============

A set of scripts to scrape and compile the House Of Lords members interets bill into a JSON object

* download.sh pulls data from http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-interests/register-of-lords-interests and writes a file per letter of the alphabet
* make.py scrapes these into a single json object and prints it.

This is a fugly hack using what I had available to me on a mostly offline train journey from Newcastle Upon Tyne to Kings Cross London.  I imagine the raw data for this is available somewhere but I couldn't find it.
